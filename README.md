### Get advice early 
before you write any code 
before you write any lenthy documents 

**instead**
1. Just Write down some rough ideas 
2. Go find some people and chat with whiteboard 
3. Even better discuss a few different potential design and evaluate 
4. Think carefully about the interface in your system 
5. Imagine other hypothetical clients trying to use your interface
6. Document precisely, but avoid constraining implimentation 
7. Get feedback on your interfaces before implementing!

â€¢ Best way to learn is to look at well-designed interfaces
